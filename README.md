Custom printf Implementation
This project is a custom implementation of the C printf() function. The objective is to replicate its behavior, handling various types of arguments and printing them correctly according to their specified format. The core functionality should match printf() while excluding buffer management.

Requirements
Your custom printf function must be able to handle the following types of arguments:

Character type variables (%c)
String type variables (%s)
Integer type variables (%d or %i)
Unsigned integer type variables (%u)
Hexadecimal integer type variables (both uppercase and lowercase, e.g., %x and %X)
Pointer type variables (%p)
