This project consists of replicating the behavior of the printf() function in C. It is not necessary to implement the buffer management of the original function. The function must handle the following types of parameters:

Character type variables.
String type variables.
Integer type variables.
Unsigned integer type variables.
Hexadecimal integer type variables (both uppercase and lowercase).
Pointer type variables.
